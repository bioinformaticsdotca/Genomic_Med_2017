# Lab 1: Input a patient into PhenomeCentral

* Create an account at course.phenomecentral.org   
* Create a new patient. See how consent setting change which fields in the form are shown  
* Enter your favorite family into the pedigree drawing tool  
* Take a patient description and enter it & the corresponding VCF file into PhenomeCentral  
* Look at the top automatically predicted candidate genes. You can look them up on OMIM or google them to find out their associated diseases  

# Lab 2B 

* Go back to courses.phenomecentral.org  
* See the top matches for your patient. There should be both phenotypic and genetic similarity  
* Search the various matching genes/mutations to see if they are known harmful (OMIM, ClinVar, Google) 
* Contact the submitted of the other case and find your “match” within the class!
